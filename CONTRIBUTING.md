# Contributing to LLM Circuit Breaker

We love your input! We want to make contributing to LLM Circuit Breaker as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Local Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-circuit-breaker.git
cd llm-circuit-breaker
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Run tests
```bash
npm test
```

5. Run tests in watch mode during development
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Coding Style

* We use TypeScript for type safety
* We use Jest for testing
* We follow standard ESLint rules
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Testing

* Write tests for any new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for good test coverage

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hanzalagithub/llm-circuit-breaker/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests as well. When requesting a feature:

- Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- Provide examples of how the feature would be used
- Consider if this feature would be useful to other users
